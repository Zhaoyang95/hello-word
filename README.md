# Anti-lost security detection system based on ARC processor

The portable outdoor travel equipment designed by us is based on sensors to collect motion information, intelligently discriminate, realize abnormal posture recognition, and can detect the distance with the guardian in real time through combined positioning to ensure the safety of the user. Compared with the machine vision-based gesture recognition method, it has the advantages of fast speed, good real-time performance and convenient carrying.
